# Syntax

## Keywords
There are 29 keywords in SPL: \
`as` `assert` `break` `case` `class` 
`cond` `const` `continue` `default` `else` 
`fallthrough` `false` `fn` `for` `if` 
`import` `in` `lambda` `namespace` `new` 
`null` `return` `super` `switch` `this`
`true` `var` `while` `yield`

## Basic Syntax

An SPL source code file is formed by blocks, statements, and expressions.

### End Of Line
In SPL, a line must be terminated by an EOL character `;`. Otherwise, it might cause error.

### Comments
Any code after symbol `//` in that line would be omitted by SPL.
For example, 
```
code will be executed;  // comment will not be executed.
```

## Blocks
Blocks are collections of statements or expressions.\
Normally, code blocks do not evaluate to anything.

## Statements
Statements do not evaluate to any result. They only create side effects that change some status of the environment.

* ### Declaration
A declaration creates a variable in the scope that it belongs. \
A declaration is made by keywords `var` or `const`. Examples:
```
var a;
const b;
```
Where `var` defines a variable, `const` defines a constant variable. \
Variables defined using `var` can be later modified, while the ones defined using `const` can only be assigned once.

* ### Conditional Statement
Conditional statements

* ### Switch-Case Statement

* ### Cond-Case Statement
Cond-case statements are just syntax sugar for switch-case statements. \
The syntax is:
```
cond {
    case booleanExpression1 {
        ... 
    }
    case booleanExpression2 {
        ...
    }
    ...
    default {  // default case is optional.
        ...
    }
}
```

Cond-case statement `cond { ... }` is equivalent to `switch true { ... }`

## Expressions
Expressions output some value.

* ### Assignment
Assignments in SPL are expressions. It assigns the value on the right side to its left side, then returns the value. \
For example,
```
var x;
var y = (x = 3);  // or even y = x = 3
```
sets both `x`, `y` to 3.
